Exercises (and Certificates required under the A1 Skills Portfolio Repository)

Note: The extension activity is in a separate folder because a lot of the functionalities of the Student Manager (Extension) is heavily reliant on manipulating the existing contents of the text file. In order to not confuse the text file base for Exercise 3, a duplicate text file has been provided for the folder.

Note2: Do not by any means manipulate the contents of a text file during an execution cycle for Exercise 2 / 3 / 3 (Extension) because the programs will break.

Note3: Repeatedly running the Student Manager (Extension) will break how the tkinter will create StringVar() or IntVar(), close the program and try again if the error happens. A sign this bug happens is when the individual records refuse to show up after requesting for their contents on the txtarea.
